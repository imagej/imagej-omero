This repository contains code for interoperability between
[SCIFIO](http://scif.io/) and the
[OMERO server](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/).

In particular, it provides a SCIFIO `Format` implementation which offers
transparent read and write access to image pixels on an OMERO server.
